## Product Manager program [finished]
Product Managers are responsible for designing and delivering a profitable product or feature into the market.  Define product strategy and KPIs based on market analysis, pitch a product vision to get stakeholder buy-in, and design a user-centered prototype that adheres to engineering constraints. Develop an execution timeline that handles competing priorities, communicate a product roadmap that builds consensus amongst internal stakeholders, and create a comprehensive go-to-market plan based on product KPIs.

#### Product documents
* [product vision](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/First_Step_Create_Vision.pdf)  
The most effective products start with a comprehensive market-based, insight-driven strategy. Identify the right problems to solve through market research, target user definition, and market sizing. Create a compelling vision and strategy that will set up the team to solve those problems.  
* [design sprint](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/Second_Step_Design_Sprint.pdf)  
Take an idea through concept, design, and user validation phases, and create a spec to handoff to Engineering for development. Use design-thinking methodologies to explore various ideas, and then converge on a single idea. Map out the full concept through creation of a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.
* [product development](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/Third_Step_Product_Dev.pdf)  
Critical soft skills needed to manage the development and execution phase of the product. Collaborate with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to guide them through planning and execution. Manage stakeholder expectations and handle risks that arise, reprioritizing feature and sprint priorities to tackle competing requests.
* [PRD & go-to-market](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/PRD_Final_Step_Goto_Market.pdf)  
Create a plan, identify the launch risks, and figure out how to minimize their impact on your launch. Collaborate with a variety of teams including Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and more to prepare them to interface with customers as the product is launched. Execute the launch and use feedback from your customers to determine the next steps for your product.

## Data Product Manager [ongoing]
Leverage market data to amplify product development. Apply data science techniques, data engineering processes, and market experimentation tests to deliver customized product experiences. Begin by leveraging the power of **SQL** and **Tableau** to inform product strategy. Then, develop data pipelines and warehousing strategies that prepare data collected from a product for robust analysis. Finally, evaluating the data from live products, including how to design and execute various A/B and multivariate tests to shape the next iteration of a product.

#### Product documents
* Applying Data Science to Product Management  
As products become more digital, the amount of data collected is increasing. Product managers now have the opportunity to utilize this data to not only enhance existing products, but create completely new ones. Understand the role of data product managers within organizations and how they utilize data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to solve problems. Visualize your data with Tableau for statistical analysis and identify unique relationships between variables via hypothesis testing and modeling. Evaluate the output captured in statistical analyses and translate them into insights to inform product decisions.
* Establishing Data Infrastructure  
Data product managers need to ensure their products have the appropriate supporting data pipelines in place so that data collected from users can be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a data lake or warehouse that can be used for statistical analysis.   
* Leveraging Data in Iterative Product Design  
The best products adapt to market changes over time and are constantly being refined based on user feedback. With a robust data pipeline, the amount of data collected through product usage is extremely valuable to product managers for enhancing their products. Understand which data is best collected through quantitative versus qualitative methods, and how to interpret it. Learn how to apply chi-square tests to determine if results from data analysis are statistically significant. Utilize user data to create user personas that are actionable for development teams to translate into code and for building out user journey maps that describe the stages a user engages with the product along with the associated risks and opportunities. Extract insights from user journey maps to define KPIs of suggested product enhancements and design the relative hypotheses and experiments that are needed to prove the assumptions of product enhancements.
